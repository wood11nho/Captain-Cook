1. On your URP Renderer asset, set "Immediate Texture" to "Always".
2. On your URP Renderer asset, select Add Renderer Feature and add the Water_Volume feature. If your screen goes glitchy, update your unity version to 2021.1 or later.
3. Drag the "Water_Plane" object into the scene and adjust the height to your liking.
4. To adjust the water, either navigate to "WaterWorks/Materials/SSR_Water.material" or "WaterWorks/Materials/SSR_Water_Bright.material" or create a new material with the SSR_Water shader and assign it to the water plane.
