Thank you for purchasing Particle ProFX one.



First time start:

-----------------

go to Window > Select Particle Pro FX.

Now you can click through the library of Particle ProFX one.

UNITY FREE: (only Unity 4)
If you have Unity Free. The preview in the library window is not available in Unity Free.
But you can still click through each prefab in the library and previewing them in the scene.
Just doubleclick on the prefab in the hierarchy to jump to it.
You can also use the demoscene for previewing all particle prefabs.

demo scene:
ParticleProFX/DemoScene/demoScene

Mobile Development:
i have tested the demoScene on my Nexus5 and it worked.
Although the prefabs are not mobile optimized. So if 
you wish to use it for a mobile production, i highly recommend to
change the emission amount of the particles as well as reducing
the texture sheets resolution.
